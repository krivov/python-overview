# Overview

You can find Rabea's introduction notebook here: [Introduction to python and jupyter](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/scholich/python-overview/blob/master/Python_introduction.ipynb).

A more extensive introduction by Rick Muller, Sandia National Laboratories is the [Crash Course in Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/scholich/python-overview/blob/master/Crash_course_v0.6.ipynb)
that is also contained in this repository.

Also, there is a list of [Useful libraries for data science in Python](https://github.com/scholich/python-overview/blob/master/resources/python_data_libraries.md) originally compiled by Sebastian Raschka to which we added some more potentially useful libraries.
