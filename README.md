# Overview

You can find Rabea's introduction notebook here: [Introduction to python and jupyter](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/scholich/python-overview/blob/master/Python_introduction.ipynb).

A more extensive introduction by Rick Muller, Sandia National Laboratories is the [Crash Course in Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/scholich/python-overview/blob/master/Crash_course_v0.6.ipynb)
that is also contained in this repository. You can download and run/execute it on your computer directly.

Also, there is a list of [Useful libraries for data science in Python](python_data_libraries.md) originally compiled by Sebastian Raschka to which we added some more potentially useful libraries.

If you need help setting something up or have other questions or suggestions, feel free to send me an [email](mailto:scholich@pks.mpg.de).
